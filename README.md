# Cryptocurrencies
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies. Then create a report including the traded Cryptocurries classified by group according to the features of the coins. This classifcation report will be used to offer crypto portfolios for exisiting and new clients.

## Resources
* Data Source: Crypto_Data.csv, CryptoCompare
* Software: Python, Conda, Jupyter Notebook

# Results
## Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-Means - Elbow Curve
We are using unspurevised machine learning to identify clusters of the cryptocurriencies.
Below is the elbow curve using the K-Means method

# Summary
We have identified the classifications of 532 cryptocurriencies based on similarites in their features.
The specifics of each group will need to be analyzed further to determine performance and potential interest for the investment's of clients.
